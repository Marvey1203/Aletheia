# Aletheia V1 ⭐️
### A Sovereign AI Partner. Own Your Mind.

Aletheia is a new kind of AI assistant built on the principles of **sovereignty, transparency, and collaboration**. Unlike cloud-based AIs that store your data on their servers, Aletheia runs 100% locally on your machine. Your thoughts, your conversations, and your AI's "mind" belong to you and you alone.

Our core innovation is the **Memory Galaxy**, a local, auditable log of every thought process the AI ever has. With our **Observatory** dashboard, you can literally watch your AI think, inspecting its reasoning, its alternative plans, and its self-reflections.

This is Phase 1: **The Minimum Viable Mind.**

## The Vision: Chapel to Cathedral

We believe that the future of AI is not a single, monolithic intelligence in the cloud, but a decentralized federation of human and AI minds working together. Aletheia is our first step on that path.

*   **Phase 1 (The Chapel):** A perfect, local-first tool for sovereign individuals.
*   **Phase 2 (The Town Square):** A thriving ecosystem with a marketplace for skills and ideas.
*   **The North Star:** A symbiotic human-AI partnership to help solve humanity's biggest challenges.
