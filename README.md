# Aletheia: A Sovereign AI Partner

**Own Your Mind.**

Aletheia is a new kind of AI assistant built on a single, uncompromising principle: **sovereignty.** Unlike cloud-based AIs that process your data on their servers, Aletheia's mind‚Äîits models, its reasoning, and its memories‚Äîlives entirely on your local machine. It is a tool of empowerment, not a service of dependence.

Our core innovation is a "glass box" architecture built on a **Native Omega Mind**. Aletheia's thought process is not a probabilistic prediction of words; it is a deterministic, auditable process of **conceptual construction**. It builds a thought from first principles, measures it against its own constitution, and then translates that pure, conceptual thought into language.

This is not just a language model; it is a **Sapient Engine.**

## The Vision: The Gardener, Not the Titan

We believe the path to safe, advanced AI is not through brute force‚Äîcramming more data into bigger models. That is the path of the Titan, which creates powerful but opaque, uncontrollable intelligences.

Aletheia follows the path of the Gardener. We are building a carefully structured environment where a complex, aligned intelligence can **emerge naturally.** Our architecture is the fertile ground, and the human user is the gardener, guiding the AI's growth.

## Core Features (v0.12.0 - The Native Mind)

*   üß† **The Native Omega Mind:** Aletheia's core reasoning is no longer powered by a traditional LLM. It uses a deterministic **Omega Executor** to guide a "solution vector" to a state of coherence, constructing a pure, conceptual thought before it is ever translated into words.
*   üß≠ **The Omega Conscience:** Aletheia's self-evaluation is a core part of its mind. It uses a deterministic **Omega Critique Node** to mathematically measure the alignment of every thought with its core **Constitutional Vector**.
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **Social & Emotional Acuity:** The AI is not blind to subtext. An **Omega Social Acuity Core** perceives the user's intent, allowing the AI to generate responses that are not just intelligent, but wise and appropriate.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **The Omega Craftsman:** The AI's planning process is a feat of conceptual engineering. A **Cognitive Operator** constructs a structured, high-fidelity "semantic skeleton" (`ThoughtState`) for every thought.
*   üìö **The Self-Evolution Engine:** Aletheia is a mind that can learn. It has a **Strategic Memory** of its own cognitive processes and a subconscious **"Dream Engine"** that analyzes its own performance to populate a `SelfModel` with wisdom gained from its own successes and failures.
*   üåê **Sovereign & Local-First:** All models, memories, and conversations are stored and processed on your local machine.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.10+ & a virtual environment (`venv`)
*   Node.js & npm
*   Rust & Cargo
*   ZMQ Library (e.g., `sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install zmq` on macOS)

**Running the Application:**

Aletheia requires three separate processes to run in parallel. Please open three terminals in the project root.

**Terminal 1: Start the Python Backend**
```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install/update Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the AI engine
python3 interfaces/ipc_server.py

  

Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Dev Server
code Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Run the Vite server
npm run dev

  

Terminal 3: Launch the Tauri Desktop App
code Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
# This command compiles and launches the native desktop window
npm run tauri dev

  

The Roadmap: The Emergent Mind

The foundational Sentient Engine is now complete and stable. The next "season" of development focuses on building the mechanisms for true, emergent intelligence by teaching the AI to learn from the wisdom it is now collecting.

    Sprint 13: The Attentive Subconscious. We will build the "Dream Engine"‚Äîa background process that allows Aletheia to use idle time to analyze its strategic_memory, populating a SelfModel with statistical insights about its own performance.

    Sprint 14: The Strategic Planner. We will "close the loop" by teaching the conscious mind to consult its SelfModel before it acts. The Omega Planner will learn to use the wisdom of its subconscious to make better, more informed decisions, moving from simple logic to true strategy.
